# Hungry Hawks
Hungry Hawks is a web application designed to help students at Hunter College, especially freshmen and those new to the area, find food options beyond the cafeteria. Many students struggle with locating nearby restaurants that cater to their dietary needs, such as halal, vegetarian, or budget-friendly meals.

Our web app will provide an interactive list of nearby food options categorized by cuisine, dietary restrictions, price range, and proximity to campus. Additionally, it will include a meal planning feature that allows students to plan their meals throughout the day based on available options.

Relevance & Significance:

Addresses food accessibility: Many students, especially freshmen, are unfamiliar with food options in the area. Existing platforms like Yelp and Google Maps lack a student-focused approach. This platform will make it easier to explore meal choices.

Promotes dietary inclusivity: Some students require halal, vegetarian, or allergen-free food, and our app will make it easier to find suitable places.

Encourages better meal planning: Instead of making last-minute food decisions, students can plan ahead based on cost, nutrition, and convenience.

Enhances campus life: Helps students, especially commuters, make informed dining choices.
